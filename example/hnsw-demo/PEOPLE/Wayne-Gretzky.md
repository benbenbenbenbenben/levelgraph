# Wayne Gretzky

The Great One.

99. That number will never be worn again in the NHL—it was retired league-wide in honor of Wayne Gretzky.

Born January 26, 1961, Brantford, Ontario, Canada.

Statistics that seem made up:
- 894 goals (NHL record)
- 1,963 assists (NHL record by a mile)
- 2,857 points (NHL record)
- 4 Stanley Cups with Edmonton Oilers

If you removed all his goals, he'd still be the all-time points leader on assists alone.

Dominated hockey like no one before or since. Made everyone around him better. Saw the game in ways others couldn't comprehend.
