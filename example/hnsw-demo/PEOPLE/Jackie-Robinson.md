# Jackie Robinson

**January 31, 1919 – October 24, 1972**

On April 15, 1947, Jackie Robinson stepped onto Ebbets Field as a Brooklyn Dodger and broke Major League Baseball's color barrier. It was a moment that changed America.

Robinson wasn't just a symbol—he was a phenomenal athlete. Rookie of the Year in 1947. MVP in 1949. Six-time All-Star. Lifetime .311 batting average.

Before baseball, he was the first athlete at UCLA to letter in four sports: baseball, basketball, football, and track.

He endured death threats, hate mail, and abuse from fans and players alike. He responded with excellence on the field and dignity off it.

After baseball, Robinson became a civil rights activist, businessman, and advocate for racial equality. He was a Republican who supported candidates of both parties based on their civil rights positions.

His number, 42, is retired across all of Major League Baseball.
