# Usain Bolt

The fastest human ever recorded.

Born August 21, 1986, in Sherwood Content, Jamaica. Usain St. Leo Bolt holds world records in both the 100 meters (9.58 seconds) and 200 meters (19.19 seconds).

Eight Olympic gold medals. Eleven World Championship golds. The only sprinter to win Olympic 100m and 200m titles at three consecutive Olympics (2008, 2012, 2016).

His nickname "Lightning Bolt" perfectly captures his speed and electricity on the track. The signature pose—the archer's victory stance—became instantly recognizable worldwide.

Retired from athletics in 2017. Briefly pursued professional football (soccer), training with Borussia Dortmund and playing for the Central Coast Mariners in Australia.

Jamaica's favorite son. His success helped cement the Caribbean island's reputation as a sprinting powerhouse.
