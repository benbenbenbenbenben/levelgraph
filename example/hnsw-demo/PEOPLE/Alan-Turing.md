# Alan Turing

**June 23, 1912 – June 7, 1954**

Alan Mathison Turing was a British mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.

Father of theoretical computer science. Father of artificial intelligence.

His 1936 paper "On Computable Numbers" introduced the concept of the Turing machine—a theoretical device that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. This became the foundation of computer science.

During World War II, Turing worked at Bletchley Park breaking German Enigma codes. His work is estimated to have shortened the war by several years and saved millions of lives.

The Turing Test: his proposed measure of machine intelligence—whether a computer could convince a human they were talking to another human.

Prosecuted in 1952 for homosexuality (then illegal in the UK). Chose chemical castration over prison. Died two years later from cyanide poisoning, ruled a suicide.

Pardoned posthumously in 2013. The Alan Turing law now grants amnesty to men convicted of historical homosexual offenses.
