# Muhammad Ali

**January 17, 1942 – June 3, 2016**

"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee."

The Greatest. That's what he called himself, and history agreed. Muhammad Ali wasn't just a boxer—he was a cultural phenomenon, a civil rights figure, and perhaps the most recognized athlete on the planet.

Born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. in Louisville, Kentucky. Won Olympic gold in 1960 at age 18. Became heavyweight champion in 1964 by defeating Sonny Liston.

Changed his name after converting to Islam. Refused military service during Vietnam War on religious grounds. Stripped of his titles. Banned from boxing for three years. Supreme Court unanimously overturned his conviction.

Returned to become champion again. The "Rumble in the Jungle" against George Foreman in Zaire. The "Thrilla in Manila" against Joe Frazier. 

56 wins, 37 by knockout. Three-time heavyweight champion. But the numbers miss the poetry, the activism, the charisma. Ali transcended sport.

Suffered from Parkinson's disease for over 30 years before his death.
