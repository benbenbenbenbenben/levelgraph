# Ada Lovelace

**December 10, 1815 – November 27, 1852**

Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, is considered the first computer programmer. She wrote the first algorithm intended for implementation on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine in the 1840s—a century before the first modern computers existed.

Daughter of the poet Lord Byron (though she never knew him—her parents separated shortly after her birth). Her mother, fearing Ada would inherit her father's "poetic temperament," insisted she study mathematics and logic.

Worked extensively with Charles Babbage on his Analytical Engine. Her notes on the machine include what is recognized as the first algorithm, designed to compute Bernoulli numbers.

Ada saw potential in computing machines beyond pure calculation—she envisioned that such devices could manipulate symbols according to rules and could be used to compose music, produce graphics, and be useful for practical and scientific purposes.

She died of uterine cancer at age 36.

The Ada programming language was named in her honor.
