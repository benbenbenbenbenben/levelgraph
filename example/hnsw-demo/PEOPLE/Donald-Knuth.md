# Donald Knuth

Born January 10, 1938, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Professor Emeritus at Stanford University. Author of "The Art of Computer Programming"—the most influential computer science book series ever written (still in progress after 50+ years).

Creator of TeX typesetting system. Invented the concept of literate programming. Pioneered the analysis of algorithms.

Knuth famously offers $2.56 for every error found in his books (a "hexadecimal dollar"). Checks from Knuth are prized by programmers and rarely cashed.

His philosophy on software development emphasized clarity and correctness. Once said: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil."

ACM Turing Award winner (1974). National Medal of Science recipient.

Known for reading his books aloud before publication to ensure they sound right.
