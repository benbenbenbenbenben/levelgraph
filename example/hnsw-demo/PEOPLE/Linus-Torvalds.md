# Linus Torvalds

Born December 28, 1969, Helsinki, Finland.

Creator of Linux, the open-source operating system kernel that now runs most of the world's servers, all Android phones, and countless embedded systems.

Also created Git, the version control system used by software developers worldwide.

Started Linux as a hobby project in 1991 while a student at the University of Helsinki. Posted a famous message to a newsgroup: "I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu)."

It became very big. And very professional.

Known for his blunt communication style on kernel mailing lists. Has said he's "not a people person" and took a break from kernel development in 2018 to work on his interpersonal skills.

Lives in Portland, Oregon. Still maintains the Linux kernel.

His philosophy: "Talk is cheap. Show me the code."
