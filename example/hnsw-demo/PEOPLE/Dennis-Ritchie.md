# Dennis Ritchie

September 9, 1941 – October 12, 2011

Creator of the C programming language. Co-creator of Unix (with Ken Thompson).

C became the most influential programming language in history. Nearly every operating system kernel, embedded system, and systems programming language descends from or was influenced by C.

Unix, developed at Bell Labs in the late 1960s and early 1970s, became the ancestor of Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, and countless other operating systems.

Received the Turing Award in 1983 (shared with Ken Thompson).

Known for writing clean, concise code. The book "The C Programming Language" (co-authored with Brian Kernighan, known as K&R) defined a generation of programmers.

Died just days after Steve Jobs, but received far less media attention—despite arguably contributing more to the foundations of modern computing.
