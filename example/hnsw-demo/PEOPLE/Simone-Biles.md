# Simone Biles

Born March 14, 1997, Columbus, Ohio.

The most decorated American gymnast in history. Period.

32 Olympic and World Championship medals combined. 7 Olympic medals (4 gold). 25 World Championship medals (19 gold). Skills named after her: the Biles on floor, the Biles II on vault.

But Simone's greatest moment might have been stepping back. At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (held in 2021), she withdrew from several events citing mental health concerns and "the twisties"—a dangerous loss of spatial awareness. Her openness sparked a global conversation about athlete mental health.

Adopted at age 3 by her grandparents (who became her parents). Entered foster care before that. Started gymnastics at 6. The rest is history.

Came back in 2024. Proved again she's the greatest to ever do it.
