# Barbara Liskov

Born November 7, 1939.

MIT professor and winner of the 2008 Turing Award for her contributions to practical and theoretical foundations of programming language and system design.

Creator of the Liskov Substitution Principle—a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that states objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting program correctness.

Led the team that developed CLU, a programming language that introduced many features now considered fundamental: abstract data types, iterators, exception handling, and garbage collection.

One of the first women to earn a PhD in computer science in the United States (Stanford, 1968).

Her work on data abstraction influenced essentially every modern programming language.
