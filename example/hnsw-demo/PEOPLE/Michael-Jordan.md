# Michael Jordan

Born February 17, 1963. Basketball player. Six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. Five MVP awards. Changed the game forever.

His Airness. The GOAT debate often starts and ends with MJ. Cultural icon beyond basketball—Air Jordan sneakers became a billion-dollar brand. Space Jam star. Competitive to a fault.

Retired three times. Won a championship every time he played a full season in the 90s. 10 scoring titles. Olympic gold medalist. Owner of the Charlotte Hornets.

Stats don't tell the whole story: it's the moments. The flu game. The shot against Cleveland. The final shot against Utah. The tongue. The competitiveness.
