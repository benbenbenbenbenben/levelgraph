# Grace Hopper

Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper (December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was a computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. She was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first linkers.

"Amazing Grace" popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, leading to the development of COBOL.

Famous for finding the first actual computer bug—a moth trapped in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer.

Her philosophy: "It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission."

Retired from the Navy at age 79 as the oldest serving officer. Awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously in 2016.

Compiler inventor. COBOL pioneer. Teacher. The USS Hopper (DDG-70) was named in her honor.
