# Tim Berners-Lee

Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee, born June 8, 1955, invented the World Wide Web in 1989 while working at CERN.

HTML. HTTP. URLs. The first web browser. The first web server. He invented all of it.

Knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work. Received the Turing Award in 2016. Named one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century by Time magazine.

Unlike many internet pioneers, he could have patented his invention and become enormously wealthy. Instead, he insisted the web remain free and open.

Founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to oversee web standards. Currently campaigns for web accessibility and against the centralization of the internet.

His original proposal at CERN was returned with the note "Vague, but exciting."
