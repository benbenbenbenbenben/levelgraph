# Margaret Hamilton

Born August 17, 1936.

Director of the Software Engineering Division at MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed the on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo program.

She coined the term "software engineering"—a phrase that at the time was met with amusement.

Her Apollo code was built to be robust. During the Apollo 11 moon landing, the computer became overloaded with tasks. Hamilton's software design allowed it to recognize the problem and keep only the most critical tasks running. The landing succeeded.

Received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016 from Barack Obama for her contributions to Apollo.

Started her career as a programmer while her husband was in law school. Brought her daughter Lauren to work at MIT on weekends. Lauren would play astronaut while Margaret worked on the code that would actually take astronauts to the moon.

Her software never failed.
