# Add more godoc examples for advanced features

The codebase could benefit from more runnable godoc examples.

## Suggested Examples

1. **Facets** - Show how to add and query faceted triples
2. **Journal** - Demonstrate journaling and recovery
3. **Vector Search** - Show semantic search integration
4. **Navigator** - Demonstrate the fluent traversal API
5. **Complex Queries** - Show multi-step pattern matching with Search()

## Location
Add to example_test.go as `func Example_*()` functions.

## Priority
Low - Documentation enhancement, not critical for functionality.
