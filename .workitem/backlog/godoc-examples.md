# Add more godoc examples for advanced features

The codebase could benefit from more runnable godoc examples.

## Completed Examples

1. ✅ **Facets** - `Example_facets()` - Shows how to add and query faceted triples
2. ✅ **Journal** - `Example_journal()` - Demonstrates journaling for audit trails
3. (Already existed) **Navigator** - `Example_navigator()` - Demonstrates the fluent traversal API

## Remaining Suggestions

4. **Vector Search** - Show semantic search integration (requires model files, harder to make portable)
5. **Complex Queries** - Show multi-step pattern matching with Search() (partially covered by Example_search)

## Priority
Low - Documentation enhancement. The core examples are now complete.
