# Phase 3: Search/Join Operations

Implement the search and join query system:
- Basic join algorithm (equivalent to JS JoinStream)
- Query planner with size estimation for optimal query ordering
- Sort-merge join algorithm (equivalent to JS SortJoinStream)
- Variable binding and solution generation
- Solution filtering (sync and async style)
- Materialization - transform solutions into new triples
- Support for multi-condition searches
